 Some of the business questions that I feel would be critical for our operations are.
 
1. The management has decided to expand our operation base in the next period. Is that a good
decision?

2. How can we improve the satisfaction level of our customers? To answer this major question, we
have to answer these subquestions
- What was the major causes of their dissatisfaction?
- Would it be beneficial to launch an 1 day delivery service like Amazon prime delivery?
- Which areas should be targeted (such as more stores, kiosks, customer interaction) more?
- Which product categories are performing well and which are performing poorly?

The processes involved are:

- Time series forecasting using the ARIMA model.

- Ngram analysis using concepts of NLP.

- Data Visualisation using Tableau

- Data manageent and optimization using MongoDb.
